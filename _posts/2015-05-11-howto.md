## I. Directory Tree of This Site

The full diretories and files are listed here:

```
.
├── about
├── assets
├── css
├── groups
├── _includes
├── js
├── _layouts
├── _posts
├── _sass
├── schedule
├── _site
├── 404.html
├── about.md
├── _config.yml
├── index.html
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── robots.txt
└── sitemap.xml
```

You will only need to know about `assets`, `_posts` and `schedule` directories to post an article.

The `assets` is for uploaded files, like pictures, documents, tar balls and etc. The sub-directories are listed here:

```
.
├── doc
├── img
├── pkt
└── src
```

So, `doc` for documents like PDF files, `img` for pictures, `pkt` for compressed files and `src` for some pieces of code.

`_posts` is for all **Markdown** files. You must name these files as the format of `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-TITLE.md`. For example, this article's name is `2015-05-11-howto.md`, and it will be transfered to a url like `http://address/2015/05/11/howto.html`, as what you can see from your browser.

There is only one **Markdown** file under `schedule` directory. If you posted an article, you might need to update the address of your post on the `index.md`.

## II. Markdown Format

There is a good introduction [here](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/). Some other techniques might also be needed on this site, and I'll list them here.

### 1. How To Start a Post with This Site

You will need to create a **Markdown** file under `_post` as **section I** described and start it with:

```
---
layout: LAYOUT
title: "TITLE"
---
```

For example, this post starts with:

```
---
layout: post
title: "Howto: Post an Article on This Site"
---
```

### 2. Present a Picture on Current Page

You can include a picture directly from some link:

```
![Description](Url)
```

For example, `![Google log](https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo11w.png)` will be turned into:

![Google log](https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo11w.png)


You can also put some pictures under `assets/img` directory and refer to it like `![Architecture](/assets/img/yfs-arch2.png)`, and you will get:

![Architecture](/assets/img/yfs-arch2.png)

### 3. Draw a Table

```
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
```

will be:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

## III. Deployment

To deploy this site, you need to install **Ruby**, **jekyll** gem from **Ruby** and **NodeJS**. You can install **Ruby** and **NodeJS** from your repository, install **jekyll** by:

```
gem install jekyll
```

Then you will get a basic environment for working. To serve, you can run `jekyll serve` under your project directory directly, and then you can access it with `http://localhost:4000`.

To generate a static site to some specific directory, you can run `jekyll build -d DIR` and the whole site will be generated under `DIR`. Reference [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
